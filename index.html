<h2>Who is a frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>A frontend developer's role is to bridge the gap between design and technology. They take a design, usually provided by a UX/UI designer, and translate it into a functional and interactive web interface</p>
<p>This involves more than just coding; it requires an understanding of user experience principles, accessibility standards, and performance optimization. They often use modern frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build complex, single-page applications efficiently.</p>
